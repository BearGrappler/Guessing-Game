	<h3> Description of the game

	<p>"In this guessing game, the computer will come up with a random number between 1 and 1000. The player must then continue to guess numbers until the player guesses the correct number. For every guess, the computer will either say "Too high" or "Too low", and then ask for another input. At the end of the game, the number is revealed along with the number of guesses it took to get the correct number."
